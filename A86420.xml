            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119779:3"/>and my former unkinde dealings with him; but being ſenſible how much this opinion ſpreads, and what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequences are produced by it, I could not but after a ſerious ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God endeavour to anſwer your deſires herein, and the rather, knowing that it is one of the general ways wherein the Devil deludes poor ſouls, for I have found by experience, that theſe two ways are the general Heads the Devil commonly goes upon, and gradually proceeds in, to draw away ſouls from the good way of the Lord; firſt perſwading men under ſpecious pretences, to allegorize Scaiptures, and turn all into a more ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and enjoyment than at preſent they have attained to, who ſtand by the Rule of Truth in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Goſpel order and ordinances, and this is backed on as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſpecious pretences of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, though in truth it is that which ends in carnality, though at the
<pb facs="tcp:119779:3"/>firſt it doth not ſo appear, which I can ſadly witneſs; the Devil commonly imploys this way, with ſuch ſpirits that are taken with curioſity of words and notions, leaving the wholeſom Word of the Lord. The ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way the Deluder takes, is by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the way of God and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel under a greater way of rationality, though it be but that which doth anſwer that reaſon which indeed is carnal, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> at large; this ſecond way the Devil takes many who are not capable of the firſt; but both are very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and though the firſt was my proper ſnare, yet I judg it not amiſs to let ſome part of my imployment be alſo to diſcover the ſecond, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my weak ability in this writing I have endeavoured, deſiring the Lord it may accompliſh that end which you and I deſire, to wit, the putting a ſtop to that opinion which
<pb facs="tcp:119779:4"/>the Author of thoſe Queries doth hold forth, which in many places doth ſo ſadly ſpread, and for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the weak that are ready to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſo deſiring the Lord in his power and preſence to own it; I ſhall ſay no more as to the matter, nor end, but commend you to God and the Word of his grace; I remain,</p>

            <p>COurteous Reader, I am ſenſible the Devil never wants cunning inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to court men to the imbracement of evil, and wants no ability to mannage his wiles to take mens hearts off from owning good, and I am ſenſible that he needs go no further to incenſe thee againſt this matter, than his uſing Arguments from the former miſcarriages, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſufficiency of the Author. But it is the deſire of my Soul to the Lord, that though I have formerly ſtumbled, and not ſtood ſteadfaſt in the truth; yet my unſuitableneſs may not ſtave you off from a ſerious conſideration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is here expreſt; I muſt confeſs that I am not apt to think it may do ſo, becauſe the ſame temptations have been in mee, by which I had been almoſt taken
<pb facs="tcp:119779:5"/>off from ever appearing publickly bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Teſtimony for truth, having been for a long time ſuch a cloud to truth; yet being as you will ſee by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing matter ſo providentially put upon it, and beſides ſeing that great neceſsity for it, this opinion of free will, with the reſt therein expreſt, do increaſe ſo much in theſe Northern parts, and it comes with ſuch a face of rationality, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor precious hearts who are weak in the faith are apt to ſtumble, and in an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall manner ſome about <hi>Hull,</hi> where I was an eye and eare witneſs not long ſince of the ſad diſaſter that is befaln the Church of Chriſt there upon that account; therefore in tenderneſs of Love to them, and anſwering the Deſires of the People with whom I walk, and for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this opinion ſpreading further here, I could not but break over the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, I mean, the ſence of my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and the great objections that will endeavour to be made by men oppoſite to the truth againſt the matter, from the
<pb facs="tcp:119779:5"/>inſufficiency of the Author, but I truſt the Lord, (or at leaſt I deſire it) that he will give you a heart to look above the inſtrument to him who is the Author and fountain of truth it ſelf; conſidering that it is not the excellency of means, but the truth of the matter that we are to mind, it was <hi>I Cor. 27.28.</hi> and ſtill is Gods way to manifeſt truth by weak and contemptible means, that ſo truth may be entertained upon its own naked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſure I am we have too long imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced truth, upon confidence of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Author, not Saint-like exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matter, or elſe concluding our judgment upon all when we have ſeen or read but part, all which I deſire thee to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void in reading this ſmall Treatiſe; which though the dreſs is ſuch, that will not court mens fancies, it was not for that end intended, but that truth may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in thy affections, that it may appear to be ſo, both in you and me; it is ihe deſire of my Soul, that we may live in the power, life and ſpirit of Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:119779:6"/>and ſo be ſure we can bear a Teſtimony in our lives, to what our words, or lines do diſcover, leſt we be found in the day of the Lord too light; which day is a coming and will not tarry. And even <hi>Sion</hi> it ſelf cannot be a ſhelter to cover Hypocrites, but in the day of the Lord their fear will be fearfull, <hi>Iſai 33.14.</hi> A virgins ſtate with light in our Lamps, without oyle in our veſſels, will not make way, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in that day, <hi>Mat. 25.11, 12.</hi> neither will preaching nor propheſying, <hi>Mat. 7.22, 23.</hi> neither will our being calld by the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor paſſing through the waters of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor ſwearing by the name of the Lord, nor calling our ſelves of the holy City, <hi>Iſai 48.1, 2.</hi> (do it) without a real oneneſs with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is alwayes accompaned with ſoundneſs of principle, and ſuitableneſs in practice; not in bare words and formes, but in power and life in each performance; that it may be thus, with you and me, it is and ſhall be the earneſt prayer of him that is (Courteous Reader) one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires

            <p>BEloved, it is wonderfull to conſider, how far <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath darkned the Glorious and pure truthes of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with his vails, vizards, and covers, ſo that it is hard to find out their face or form; as alſo to reſtore any one truth to its primitive inſtitution and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though God is pleaſed many times by an eminent hand, to bring truth to light, notwithſtanding theſe falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which do yet lye upon it, as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though much diſcovered by others; yet when I conſider where the cauſe of all this is, not in the truth it ſelf, but in mens blindneſs and darkneſs in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, and (which is yet worſe) it being like ſo to remain till the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall take hold of them, therefore the conſideration of this ſhould ſtay our ſpirits, when we ſee ſuch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, oppoſitions, and carnal reaſonings,
<pb facs="tcp:119779:7"/>againſt the clear and pure truth of God in the Scriptures; and now ſeeing our dear Brother, the Author of this Treatiſe hath endeavoured to bring forth his Talent in the behalf of truth, in anſwer to thoſe Queries, wherein I judg that God hath in a good meaſure inabled him to give a clear anſwer, to the ſatiſfiing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of them who are or have been apt to ſcruple or ſtagger at the truth which is here affirmed by him, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Saints, I judg that this light of of his ſhould not be put under a Buſhell, but he brought forth to publick view; ſo that if there be in it that which may give ſatisfaction to one, it may be uſefull, the rather when I conſider, what neceſſity there is of it, in other places, where the words of ſuch kinde of perſons are like the words of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> which will eat as doth a Cancer; this is the ground of his ſo appearing in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick way; yet what room and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may have or meet withall among the ſons of men, I know not, becauſe we know that wiſdome is onely juſtified of
<pb facs="tcp:119779:8"/>her children, if it be ſo among wiſdomes children, it doth accompliſh wiſdoms end, and therein we have ours; Poſsibly it may meet with reproches and ſcorns, either in reſpect of its dreſs and habit it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in; which was minded to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but could not well be avoyded, it being the onely ſuitable way to him, to make out his mind in, namely Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms, and the rather becauſe <hi>Haggers</hi> book which he anſwers runs in the ſame ſtrain, or in relation to the Author a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom ſome may be ready to cavil, and ſo ſlight and undervalue the truth, poſsibly conceiving him to have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dead, if not twice dead, as to ſuch appearances, yet not pluckt up by the roots; I know it may ſeem ſtrange to many, that he ſhould now appeare in the houſe of God, the ſtrangeneſs of which, hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held as much by me as by any; and wee have been ready to wonder at the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable rich grace, patience and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God towards him, who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walked in notions and pretences of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, though in wantonneſs againſt
<pb facs="tcp:119779:8"/>
               <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Were it not that the Lord is mercifull, becauſe he delighteth to be mercifull, we had not known how or where to have centered our judgments and underſtandings concerning him in that condition; yet knowing there is no difference where God makes none, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſatisfied, the rather, I being an eye witneſs of the Authors great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and change, not onely in reference to a gratious frame of heart, and a cloſe walking with God daily; but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe his many principles as to notions, which were imbraced by him, and I fear too much by many now, to the turning of their minds aſide, from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel and the truth as it is in Ieſus; if the truth here affirmed ſhall take place in any hearts, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of their judgments and keeping their conſciences free from error, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; we wiſh the Lord may have the praiſe, and we ſhall have cauſe therein to reioyce. Friends, I judg that now things will no longer go upon truſt as formerly the truthes of God have too much gone
<pb facs="tcp:119779:9"/>upon the leggs of humane teſtimony, now therefore it is our deſire, it may go upon tryal, Gold loſeth nothing by its tryal, but its nature is diſcovered more excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; to the Law and to the teſtimony; there muſt be a day of fining and trying, Gold muſt appear to be Gold and Droſs to be Droſs, it will no longer paſs for current with god, though it doth with men; therefore it behoveth all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to have their loynes girt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with truth; this is all at preſent I ſhall ſay, either in behalf of the Author, or matter, or perſons to whom it is to be tendered, and ſo ſhall deſire daily to pray for your furtherance in the Goſpel, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring while I am in this tabernacle, on this ſide glory, to approve my ſelf in the ſight of God;</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ear Friend, I received fourteen Queries from you, deſtring my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about the Death of CHRIST, the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Creature, and the Juſtice of God relating to the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with them ten Abſurdities, which you are pleaſed to annex to the Queries; but as for the Abſurdities I ſhall leave them till ſeaſonably I may anſwer them, and come to ſhew you the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of them, onely one or two things, firſt as to them, minde,
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, to draw Abſurdities from the croſs Anſwer of your Queries, before your Queries are anſwered is but a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</item>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:119779:10"/>
                  <item>Secondly, the drawing Abſurdities from the Anſwer of your Queries, or what you judg will be the Anſwer, doth ſhew that you do not propound Queries to be informed, becauſe you conclude your Anſwer before you propound them, or elſeyour Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be but the fruit of fancy, the truth of which will appear when we ſhall ſpeak to them: now to ſpeak to your Queries one by one as they are there laid down will neither be proper nor profitable, becauſe the foundation of the moſt of them is from a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuppoſition, to wit, That I and the reſt do not hold that CHRIST died for all, which is contrary to our judgments; for we do hold that CHRIST did die for all, but not for all alike; therefore the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of your Querie which relates to the Death of CHRIST will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear groundleſs, and ſeeing that your Queries want foundation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I judg ſome of them contain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119779:10"/>contradiction; I ſhall not ſpeak to them one by one: now that we may not uphold contention, but in the fear of the Lord ſpeak for information, knowing where the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and you lieth, which gives you advantage to put ſo many forms upon Queries, and faces upon Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to preſent your opinion, though groundleſs yet pleaſing, I ſhall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſmall ability the Lord gives me, in anſwer to my relation to truth, lay down and ſpeak to theſe things following, and ſo in the cloſe anſwer your Queries and Abſurdities.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, wherein you and we do ſeem to be one in judgment, as to the Death of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where we differ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ground of your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes as to the Death of CHRIST, the ability of the Creature, and the clearing up of the Juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the ſad Abſurdities, which of neceſſity muſt follow your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119779:11"/>opinion, not that which is to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but which is already diſcovered, in your profeſt poſition in your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then you will ſee the neceſſity of the retorting of the moſt of the Abſurdities upon your ſelf, and the reſidue of them muſt needs fall, as to us, they having no foundation from us. Firſt to the firſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I do judg that CHRIST died for all, though not for all alike.</p>
            <p>Secondy, that his Death without any exemption, is to be preſented to all.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that he died for all, I ſhall prove it by Scripture, and then ſhew you how; to prove this truth that CHRIST died for every man, I ſhall not prove it from theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 6.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.14. and my reaſon for it in; thoſe Scriptures though they ſpeak out the word [all] and the word [world] yet there is no ſafety to make poſitive concluſions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119779:11"/>upon doubtfull expreſſions, I mean as to the nature and meaſure of the word [all] or [world] for ſometimes the word [world] includes the whole, as <hi>Job</hi> 34.18. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 24.1. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.12. 98.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the word [world] is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a part as well as the whole, as in theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.17. <hi>chap.</hi> 15.18, 19. <hi>chap.</hi> 17.6, 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.6, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as the word [world] doth include ſometimes a part, ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of that part, it doth intend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the wicked of the world, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>chap.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.7. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. Again in other places it doth alſo properly intend onely the Profeſſors or Believers in CHRIST as in theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 12.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12, 15. <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 23. Now all that can be ſaid or declared from theſe fore-mentioned Scriptures where the word [world] or [all] is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119779:12"/>where the Death of CHRIST is declared, or Reconciliation by him is to you very doubtfull, whether it be to every one, or onely Believers, and therefore ſeeing that a doubtfull ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is no foundation for infallible concluſions, nor to end any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in diſcourſe, becauſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as ſtrong in the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and convinces none, but produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth diſputes in all; therefore I ſhall in my Anſwer not poſſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from, but ſet them aſide in this diſcourſe, and draw my proof as I told you before, either from Scripture or Reaſon that doth ariſe no other way then from an abſolute neceſſity.</p>
            <p>So now to my Affirmation, which is, that CHRIST died for every man, but not for alike.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that he died for every man, for the proof of that ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. he is the Saviour of every man, but eſpecially, ſo there is a common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by CHRIST intended to all.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119779:12"/>This truth is alſo made good in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. where he declares ſome men to be men of deſtruction, and tells them that they had denied the Lord that bought them; ſo that wicked men and men of deſtruction were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the purchaſe of CHRIST, further ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you what I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in it, and my Grounds for it, beſides what already hath been ſaid, conſider, all men were comprehended in <hi>Adam,</hi> according to Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. And what God ſpeaks as to bleſſing and curſing, when he ſpeaks to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.17. ſaying, In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death; now <hi>Adam</hi> when he eat fell, all men fell in him and came under this curſe, according to theſe Scriptures <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 15, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22.</p>
            <p>Now what the Lord ſaith muſt be true and exactly performed, which was in the very day when he eat, he muſt die, which word [death] doth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119779:13"/>comprehend death, in every ſenſe. Now had not JESUS CHRIST been brought forth by the Lord to ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pronunciation of the curſe and the act meriting, and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the curſe, man muſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have died, or elſe God had not been exact in his Word, but we know he is: Now CHRIST was brought forth to bear the wrath of the Lord, and the ſatisfaction of his Juſtice, in that great breach and gap that man had made, and ſo CHRIST was the Saviour of every man from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that curſe, and they have ſome time to live here in the world, or elſe their deſtruction had been in their conception, either of all or ſo many as CHRIST did not undertake for, for Gods Word is exactly true in all things. So that in the firſt ſenſe, CHRIST is the Saviour of all men from the execution of that curſe, at which time, and in which purchaſe, the world is no longer Gods upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119779:13"/>old account; but as it is the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of JESUS CHRIST, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.3, 8. applied to the 42. where God hath given the utmoſt part of the earth and Nations of the Heathen to CHRIST for his portion: ſo it comes to paſs that mercy is extended according to theſe Scriptures both to the juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.9. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, CHRIST by his Death doth not onely free the Creature from the immediate execution of that curſe, but he hath alſo taken them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dreadfull killing power of that ſtate which man was in when he fell, which was to lie under the fire and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling appearances of God, in that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Law, nothing ſtanding between God as fire, and they as ſtubble, but he hath brought them into a ſtate and under the authority of himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a ceſſation from that fiery appearance of God, and they are now
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119779:14"/>under the tender of life and ſalvation by JESUS CHRIST, according to theſe Scriptures <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.38. <hi>chap.</hi> 24.14. <hi>chap.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. <hi>ch.</hi> 14.9. <hi>chap.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. And this is to be done for the gathering out the choſen of God from the world, till CHRIST hath brought his Enemies under his feet, and then reſign up the Kingdom to his Father, and God become all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Scriptures which I have brought, which are ſufficient to prove what I affirmed, yet for your further ſatisfaction minde my Reaſons, to prove that every one hath the benefit of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death in thoſe two things before expreſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt Particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt Reaſon, that which was inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the curſe muſt needs be in the immediate execution prevented by CHRIST. But the immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a temporal death, muſt needs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119779:14"/>be included in the curſe, therefore,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is not queſtionable, the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition is proved by this Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſon. That which was a fruit of ſin muſt be comprehended in the curſe, but a natural death is a fruit of ſin, therefore</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition none will deny, the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 56. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.6. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Job</hi> 24.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.10. Beſides theſe Scriptures I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition thus:</p>
            <p>Reaſon. If any thing that is a part of a temporal death be a fruit of ſin, then is the whole; but afflictions and pains in men and women, which is a part of a temporal death is a fruit of ſin, therefore,</p>
            <p>None can deny the <hi>Major,</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is proved from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.33, 35. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Iſai</hi> 3.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.7.</p>
            <p>Now as the freedom from any thing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119779:15"/>of this temporal miſery is a fruit of CHRIST, ſo what comes inſtead of that, as the enjoyment of life with other mercies of this world, with the Sun ſhining and the Rain falling upon the juſt and unjuſt muſt needs be a fruit of CHRIST which extends to all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.6.</p>
            <p>Now my Reaſons to prove this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing, to wit, that all men are by CHRIST brought, under the authority and power of CHRIST, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Life by him, are theſe:</p>
            <p>Reaſon. Firſt, that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures declares to be a truth we muſt believe, but that all men in that ſtate are under the power and authority of CHRIST, and diſcoveries of Life by him, the Scriptures declare; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition none can deny, the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119779:15"/>
            <p>Secondly, if mens ſins be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the abuſe of the mercies they enjoy, in being under the authority and diſcoveries of CHRIST, then to be under the authority and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of CHRIST muſt needs be a benefit; but mens ſins are aggravated by their abuſing of mercies that they enjoy under the authority and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of CHRIST; therefore,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved by this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſon. Sin is never aggravated, but either by the extent of a Law, or diſcoveries of Love; and if ſin be aggravated, as before expreſt, then it muſt be either by the extent of the Law, or diſcoveries of mercy; and if either it diſcovers the truth of the <hi>Major,</hi> to wit, that they are under the authority and diſcoveries of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom now all Law and Love is handed out to poor creatures, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all under his power: the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition is proved from theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119779:16"/>
               <hi>John</hi> 15.22, 24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more as to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, concerning the extent of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death to every man, but ſhall now ſpeak to the ſecond part of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, to wit, that CHRIST did not die for all alike: now that I may not ſpeak to maintain that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt way of mens exerciſing wit to conquer one another, but ſhall deſire in the fear of the Lord and the love of his truth, to ſpeak to inform you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the difference relating to you and others about the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to maintain my Affirmation, to wit, that CHRIST died not for all alike. Now judging that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals following will help forward that work, I ſhall in this part of my Affirmation propound them, and ſpeak to them, which are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that there is a people that God hath choſen, and elected in his Son before the world was.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119779:16"/>
            <p>Secondly, that he had a ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for the advancement of his grace and love, to carry on by CHRIST for them and them onely.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that this great deſign of CHRIST for them was and muſt be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that this great deſign of God in CHRIST for them, and onely them, was ſatisfaction for all ſin, and the purchaſe of ſalvation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life by him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that faith which is required of all them that enjoy him, is not a cauſe but an effect of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned privilege.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, that the publiſhing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the fore-mentioned privileges, which is the Goſpel, is Gods way or means to effect or produce faith or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel-obedience in the heart of his own.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that that faith which is produced in obedience to truth, by the diſcoveries of the Goſpel of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119779:17"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not the bringing up of ſome thing that is in men before converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But it is a peculiar work of God, which nature in the higheſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not capable of till converſion or the new work of grace be wrought, which work is Gods, not upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but a ſpecial and Goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, wrought by him.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, that it is Gods minde and way, and a neceſſity it muſt be ſo for the advancement of his Grace; and the accompliſhing, begetting of faith in the hearts of his own, that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is to be preſented or diſcovered to all without any exemption as to the declaration of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſpeak to theſe eigth particulars orderly; which when I have done; then that part of my affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will appear to be true, to wit, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not for all alike.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to the firſt which is, that there is a people that God hath choſen and elected in his Son before the world
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119779:17"/>was, the proof of which I ſhall make good ſo clearly from Scripture, and by the truth of ſuch reaſons by Scripture, that I hope through the Grace of God it may be a means to inform you; the firſt ſcripture is, the 2. of <hi>Timo.</hi> 1.9. where the Apoſtle declares this truth; who hath ſaved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Grace which was given us in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> before the world began; I need not paraphraſe upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, they are without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that truth that God will owne, which is, that ſaving and election was determined by God, for his people, before they were called, or did any works ſuitable to the worth of that mercy.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Scripture is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. acording as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119779:18"/>that ſhews that election was in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and was before the foundation of the world, and it further ſheweth that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love in Saints was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, not as cauſes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but as conſequences that muſt needs follow, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> heard they were glad, and glorified the Lord, <hi>(and as many as were ordained to eternall life believed)</hi> this declares, that they that have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life were ordained to it, and that faith was not the cauſe, but an effect of it, therefore ordination muſt be, before; there are many more Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but theſe are ſufficient; now to the reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt Reaſon; whatſoever is made good by God in the concluſion of time, muſt needs be concluded of God before all time; but the election of his own is made good in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of time: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> none will deny; but the <hi>Major,</hi> which is, whatſoever is made good in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119779:18"/>concluſion of time, it muſt needs be concluded of God before all time; my reaſons to prove that are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, whatſoever comes to paſs, was before determined of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Job</hi> 14.5, 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 20.29. <hi>Iſai</hi> 46.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.3. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whatſoever before was determined of God, doth and muſt come to paſs, which is clear from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Ch.</hi> 21.30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Job</hi> 23.14. <hi>Ch.</hi> 30.23. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.27, 29, 35. Beſides that, minde this (Reaſon) God who comprehends all, from whence all things take their Riſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no alteration or change in him ſelf, but what is before was, and what was muſt be, and whoſoever ſaith the contrary, muſt prove theſe 3. things.</p>

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Whatſoever God doth do for us in relation to Heaven, before grace was wrought in us, is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time; but Election or chuſing of us is done for us before grace is wrought in us. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I need not ſtand to prove the <hi>Major,</hi> it is ſo unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable; the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10, 19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſai</hi> 43.23, 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſai</hi> 56.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20. <hi>John</hi> 10.16. And ſo much for the firſt particular.</p>
            <p>Now to the ſecond, which is, that he had a ſpecial deſigne for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Grace and love to carry on by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them and them onely; what the great deſigne is I have in ſome part told you, but if you would further know the great Deſign of God for his People, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119779:19"/>of his own glory and grace, and would underſtand the time, way and means, and the truth of the thing that there is ſuch a thing, as a great deſign of God, minde well theſe Scriptures <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 63, 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24, 25, 26, 27, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.15, 16. In all which Scriptures the particular will clearly be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if you queſtion the ſingularity of the deſigne in this word for them and them, onely for the manifeſting of that, mind this reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſon: what is good in Gods ſight muſt be done by him, but ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in his love to ſome, or his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his love in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſome, and not to others, is good in Gods ſight; <hi>(ergo)</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from the Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26.</p>
            <p>The third thing that this great deſign of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them, was and muſt be accompliſhed, that is clearly made good from theſe Scriptures,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119779:20"/>
               <hi>Iſai</hi> 59.1, 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 55.11. <hi>John</hi> 19.51.</p>
            <p>If you deſire any Reaſon beſides what is brought, minde this, ſuitable to the Author muſt the Act be; but he that carrieth on this deſign is God, whoſe power is infinite, whoſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſel is unalterable, whoſe intents are undividable, whoſe will conſidered in himſelf muſt ſtand, all which you may plainly ſee if you minde theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33.11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.30. <hi>Iſai</hi> 44.26. <hi>Iſai</hi> 46.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.28.</p>
            <p>The fourth particular, which is, that the deſign of God in CHRIST for them, was ſatisfaction for all ſin, and the purchaſe of ſalvation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life by him, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.45, 46. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.25, 26.27. And further to manifeſt this Truth, minde theſe three Particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>God ordained,</hi> Chriſt <hi>to that end,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68, 69.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God fitted</hi> Chriſt <hi>for that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119779:20"/>end, Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Iſai</hi> 42.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>what</hi> Chriſt <hi>was ordained to and fitted for was finiſhed by him, John</hi> 19.28, 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.30.</p>
            <p>Now if any ſhould ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did accompliſh the ſame deſign for all, as well as for ſome, they do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abuſe Gods intent in Scripture, and lay weakneſs upon God, as if he could not carry on what he did intend and in ſufficiency upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or elſe you muſt deny theſe three things, to wit,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>that God ordained</hi> Chriſt <hi>to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods fitting of</hi> Chriſt <hi>for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>did accompliſh what he was ordered and fitted for;</hi> which to deny is very ſad. Now though what hath been ſaid is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove this fourth thing, yet to ſatisfie you that this privilege that we have been now ſpeaking of, is for ſome and not for all; I beſeech you in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119779:21"/>tenderneſs to God, and love to your own ſoul, and the honor of Truth, minde theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, though this Scripture which is Gods Word doth declare what God ſays, and what at preſent God doth, yet it is his eſſential will that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare fully and exactly what God is, which will is in himſelf, and himſelf ſo in that will, that his will is and muſt be himſelf, which ſelf is not ſo much diſcovered in the form and face of preſent things, as by the concluſion of things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the truth of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by Prophets be to be judged by the concluſion, or making good what they declare, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.7, 8. applied to the 15. then much more this truth we have been a ſpeaking to, is to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the concluſion, which if you do you muſt of neceſſity hold that the great deſign of God and CHRIST, which was ſatisfaction for all ſin, and purchaſe of ſalvation, and everlaſting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119779:21"/>life, muſt be for ſome and not for all, or elſe this Scripture muſt be needleſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though in the declaration of the Goſpel it be ſaid, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes ſhall be ſaved, which is a truth, yet there is no Scripture that declares either by Propheſie or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that every one in the world doth or ſhall believe; and though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment be univerſal, that doth not decide the controverſie, for Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority extends over all, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in his language commanding of them, but the peculiarity of his love is not to be judged by the extent of his authority, but by the application or making good of his mercy, which work or privilege is but to ſome, and is ſolely his work, as we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhew you.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, though faith be required in the declaration, and is the way to enjoy the manifeſtation, yet a want in faith doth not nor cannot make any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119779:22"/>alteration in the foundation, which is clear from theſe Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. applied to <hi>v.</hi>19. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2, 3, 4. Minde well, now it is clear that the foundation is Gods unchangeable love and grace, which if it were to all upon the condition of faith, giving a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the foundation, then any want in faith would work ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is contrary to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, in the fear of the Lord conſider this Scripture <hi>John</hi> 17.4. where CHRIST ſays to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Now if CHRIST was ordained or appointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfie for the ſins of all, and to purchaſe life and ſalvation for all, then he hath finiſhed it, and they muſt be ſaved, or elſe CHRIST doth not ſpeak truth, which were ſad to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but you ſee and muſt know all are not, nor ſhall not be ſaved; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not given him by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119779:22"/>to do. Now if any ſhall ſay, that CHRIST hath finiſhed the work of eternal life for any who will believe in him; I anſwer, the work cannot be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, if it depend upon any thing elſe, and eſpecially upon that which is ſo mutable as creatures minds, whether to receive or not to receive, as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; therefore without controverſie CHRIST ſpeaking truth, the work is fully finiſhed, as the pardon of ſin, purchaſe of ſalvation and eternal life by him; faith doth not make up the work, but it is a fruit that floweth from it, which is the next thing we ſhall enter upon, and ſo I ſhall ſay no more to this fourth thing, to wit, <hi>That the great deſign of God in</hi> Chriſt <hi>was to ſatisfie for all ſin; and purchaſe ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eternal life for the elect, and none but them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth thing is, <hi>that faith which is required of all them that enjoy him is not a Cauſe but an Effect of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Privilege,</hi> that is to ſay, It is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119779:23"/>not the cauſe but an effect of election, and that I ſhall punctually prove three ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>From Scripture.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>From the nature of cauſes.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>From the nature of the thing.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, from the Scripture, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. <hi>When the</hi> Gentiles <hi>heard they were glad, and glorified the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi> Which clearly ſhews that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is before faith; and this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and form CHRIST declares, when he ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15.16. <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> They had choſen CHRIST, that is to ſay, loved him, and by faith embraced him, but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is, they were firſt choſen by him, and that is the cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> And for your further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, minde theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.8.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:119779:23"/>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the order of Cauſes, and you will finde that <hi>Henry Hagar</hi> who is a man I very much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, out of whoſe Book I ſee you have drawn your Abſurdities; if you do there but ſee how he decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Cauſes, you will there finde that he makes no diſtinction of eſſential, meritorious, inſtrumental and final Cauſes, but jumbles up all together without diſtinction. Dear Friend, it is not a form of words that will make things orderly in Gods ſight, unleſs there be divine wiſdom to rectifie the judgment, making man to deny his own natural wit, when he goes about to decypher or diſcover Gods great deſign in CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Again, if you will ſay, though he ſets down ſucceſſive cauſes, yet he doth not ſet down the cauſe of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in any of theſe ſeven cauſes he mentions, neither can he unleſs he can diſcover a cauſe of him that is the Cauſe of Cauſes.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119779:24"/>
            <p>For my part I am of his judgment in theſe Particulars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That Gods love was the cauſe of his ſending of his Son to die for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>The Goſpel being preached is the cauſe of mens believing.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>That mens believing is the cauſe of juſtification, but then it is juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in conſcience, and not juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and this in conſcience is but the ſtream.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>That our knowing our ſelves juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith through the bloud of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the cauſe of our love to</hi> Chriſt.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>That our love to</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the cauſe of our obedience to</hi> Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But then the ſeventh cauſe, which is, <hi>That our obeying</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the cauſe of his giving us everlaſting life,</hi> that I deny.</p>
            <p>And if you view theſe Scriptures
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119779:24"/>he brings to prove it, is will not make it good; <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. He that believeth and is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed ſhall be ſaved, and bleſſed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gate into the City, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> being made perfect through ſuffering, he became the Author of everlaſting ſalvation, unto all them that obey him; theſe Scriptures are truth, and declare, that they that obey <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall have eternal life, but they nor no other Scripture declare anything contrary to this poſition, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the way to life but not the cauſe of life, if yea look upon cauſes either eſſential or meritorious, but if you look upon it inſtrumental, that is to ſay as the meanes or way to ſuch an end, then it is true, and ſo is faith and ſo is prayer, according to theſe Scriptures: <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.19. 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. Now when I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119779:25"/>tell you I do approve of theſe ſix cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſucceſſively before mentioned, it is alſo with this reſtriction, to put a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between cauſes, for the firſt cauſe which is Gods love, that is the efficient cauſe, 2. cauſe which is <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, is the meritorious cauſe, the 3, 4, 5, 6. cauſes he ſpoke of are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſes, and if you ſpeak of theſe things in themſelves, and as they are to us, then they are cauſes, but if you ſpeak of them all, as they relate to God, who is the Cauſe of Cauſes, then they are but effects, CHRIST'S death is but the effect of Gods love, the preaching of the Goſpel is but an effect of Gods love, faith in him is but his gift, and our love to him and obedience do all flow from him as the Fountain, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>James</hi> 1.17, 18. they cannot in that ſenſe be called cauſes but fruits.</p>
            <p>Further conſider what that Friend
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119779:25"/>ſaith in his Book, he declares a cauſe in all the ſeven things, yet he ſhews you no cauſe why God ſhould love us. Now election or chuſing is ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in the ſingularity of his love, and doth ſo live in the bowels of it, that there is no more cauſe for the one than there is for the other, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing without himſelf, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or maintain that in himſelf for us. And now the thing I would have you conſider, followeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider what we minde by election, it conſiſteth in Gods foreknowledg, wherein he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from all eternity in the riches of his grace and love, to pitch upon and make choice of ſome in a peculiar ſenſe, to be veſſels of glory, whom he elected in the election of his Son, who was the publick perſon comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole, and this prerogative of God and privilege to us, is not to be decyphered or diſcovered, like as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privileges are; for the death of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119779:26"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and our faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> theſe have the time of their riſe, reign and perfection, but for the other privilege it is done in God and with God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to any thing without himſelf, it onely depends upon the prerogative of his will, and his good pleaſure, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16, 18, 21, 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. Therefore when we ſpeak of cauſes we muſt make a diſtinction between what is done by God out of God, and what is done by God in God; and whatſoever is done in the laſt ſenſe hath no riſe but himſelf and his own pleaſure, and if you give not God this, you muſt deny his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and prove that he may not do with his own what ſeems good unto him, which is contrary to theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 16, 18, 20, 23. Now beſides what hath been already ſaid to prove that faith is but an effect and not the cauſe of election, minde theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:119779:26"/>
            <p>Firſt, if election be before men have faith, then faith cannot be a cauſe, but it muſt be an effect; but election is before we have faith. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is not to be queſtioned. The <hi>Minor,</hi> which is, that election is before faith, is proved from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. God is the firſt cauſe of cauſes, and whatſoever doth take its riſe or is immediate from, him hath no other cauſe, the truth of that you will ſee from the Scriptures before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, therefore faith muſt needs be an effect. But beſides all the Scriptures and Reaſons I have brought, Do but conſider, that election is not capable of being cauſed by any cauſes out of God, for we are elected in the election of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not merit his own election, for his Death is not the cauſe of election, though it be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe, and Gods great way to accompliſh life and ſalvation. If ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119779:27"/>be that faith is a cauſe of our election, then election is ſubject to a cauſe, and if in the leſſer then in the greater; but we know that in the greater which is the election of CHRIST, in which general all particulars are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; it is not cauſed, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon no condition or cauſes out of God, but immediately flows from him, and all other works and acts of grace and mercy done by God in CHRIST for us, or by God in us towards CHRIST, are the fruits of this fountain, I mean Gods love, in which Gods owning or chuſing is ſo involved in it, as it is one with it, and both ariſe from one and the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is his own will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Now there being ſome that make Objections againſt this truth, which peradventure may be the cauſe of your ſtumbling; I ſhall in faithfulneſs to CHRIST, and love to your ſoul mention ſome of them, and give my anſwer to them.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:119779:27"/>
            <p>Firſt, ſome there are, as <hi>Henry Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> in particular, that do acknowledg this truth from theſe places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. where it is ſaid, that <hi>God hath choſen us in</hi> Chriſt <hi>before the world was.</hi> And alſo the ſame in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. Now though they acknowledg theſe words, yet they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to evade or turn the meaning another way, by giving this anſwer, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. where it is ſaid, that <hi>God declared unto</hi> Abraham <hi>that he hath made him the father of many Nations.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. CHRIST is ſaid to be <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world.</hi> Now from thence they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. declaring the promiſe of God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God calls thoſe things that are not as though they were:</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>Abraham</hi> at that time was not the father of <hi>Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in whom the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be bleſt, and yet God ſaith, <hi>I have made thee the father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> but ſaith he, It was not ſo, for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119779:28"/>the Apoſtle doth declare it ſaying, he <hi>calls things that are not as though they were;</hi> and ſo CHRIST is ſaid to be <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> though he was not ſlain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand years after. So ſaith he, are we to underſtand election; for the Scripture ſaith, that he did chuſe and elect us before the world was, yet it was not ſo, onely <hi>God calls things that were not as if they were:</hi> therefore men ſaith he, are not elected till they are called.</p>
            <p>Now dear friend, in the fear of the Lord, as you tender the information of your own ſoul, ſeriouſly conſider what an evaſion here is, without any way in truth diſcovering what the Apoſtle intends in theſe expreſſions; for without controverſie when God ſaid, <hi>I have made thee a father of many Nations,</hi> he ſpake truth, without any ſuch evaſion as our carnal wits will prompt us to believe.</p>
            <p>But that I may give an Anſwer to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119779:28"/>this Objection, judging that if that cover were removed, the truth would lie naked. I deſire you to minde in Anſwer to it theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in every action there is theſe three things to be conſidered.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The life or virtue of the Act.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>The fruit of the Act.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>The form of the Act.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The life of the Act is that which produceth the form, the fruit of the Act lives in the life, and is ſpoke out, or brought forth by the form, had not this bin ſo the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> could never have brought a curſe upon his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the life of his act was in unity, in all that were comprehended in his perſon, and the evil fruit of his act took place upon all, in that ſenſe, when it took place upon him, but the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation or execution of this took place ſucceſſively as Creatures were brought forth, and ſo it appears the form of the act, was to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt according unto the ſucceſſion or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119779:29"/>appearance of forms in Creatures; but the life of the act from whence the denomination of the act comes, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acted and executed in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo in the promiſes of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> you are to look upon the life or virtue of the promiſe, the fruit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the form of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is but the mouth and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to ſpeak out the life by; which was made good when <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his ſeed ſucceſſively took place; ſo in CHRIST, he was a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> the life or virtue of the act, which was the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, which did ariſe from the Author and life of the act, that took place ſo ſoon as ever God did promiſe CHRIST, the form of the act, which is the language, as I told you before, to ſpeak out the life, that takes place in time, and is not formally preſented till lively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but the life or virtue of the form, that takes place for us when firſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119779:29"/>promiſed, and ſo the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was effectual ſo ſoon as ever the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was propounded, or elſe <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have died, and none could have been ſaved till CHRIST had come and ſuffered in the fleſh; the very ſame we are to minde in election, the life of the act, which is the eſſence, took place from the beginning; as to the form we ſhall minde it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Particular. Now as to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and the fruits of the act, that takes place in forms, as forms are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, but the act is as truly alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the form appears, as it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the truth is, every act takes its denomination from the life, and the antiquity is derived from thence; and ſo <hi>Abrahrm</hi> was a father of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the promiſe was firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and ſo CHRIST was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſlain, as to the life and virtue, when he was firſt promiſed, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was then done when it took place in its riſe, which was Gods ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119779:30"/>love and good will to chuſe ſome to be veſſels of glory; now when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God calls things that are not as if they were,</hi> he doth not intend the life or virtue of the act, but the form of the act, and he that denies it, endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole tenure of Scripture, for in this ſenſe we are to underſtand our fall in <hi>Adam</hi> and our riſe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the tenure of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſo alſo the promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſo we are to underſtand the intent of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28. which declares luſting after a woman to be Adultery, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. that hatred is murder, which declares the act to live in the life and virtue, though it wants its outward form, and is ſo really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the form is brought forth, and in this ſenſe we are to underſtand <hi>Chriſts</hi> love and rejoycing in the ſons of men before the world was <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider, as the life and virtue of ſome acts take place before
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119779:30"/>the form, and is really in being before the form appear either of our acts or Gods; So further minde, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done, not onely of God, but alſo in God for us, the life and form of that act, as to God takes place toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both is in being before it doth appear, though the diſcovery of that is not, till the Object to which the Action relates be brought forth, and this is true election, for that is an act done as well in God as by God, and ſo life and form take place toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to God, though as to the form of the diſcovery to us, it is not till formably we are brought forth, ſo this act is not to be paralleld with ſuch acts that God doth for us, though by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf yet our of himſelf, as Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> is; and therefore what is ſaid from the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. is not ſufficient to overthrow this truth, to wit, that election is before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, according to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119779:31"/>theſe Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Objection that is made againſt this Truth, by the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned party and ſome others, is from theſe words in 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.2. <hi>Elected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foreknowledg of God through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>We are bound to give thanks always to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath from the beginning cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto ye were called by the Goſpel.</hi> From whence they reaſon thus, If we are choſen through ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, then none are choſen before they have the Spirit and are ſanctified by the Spirit; and if Saints are choſen to ſalvation through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit and belief of the truth, and were called to believe that through hearing of the Goſpel; Then ſay they, men are not choſen before
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119779:31"/>they did believe the truth, and before they did hear the Goſpel, by which they were calld to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That kinde of reaſoning is very ſad, and unſuitable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Apoſtle in thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that their Arguments have no foundation from thence, ſeriouſly view the words the Apoſtle ſaith in both the places, that <hi>we are choſen to ſalvation through ſanctification, unto obedience and belief of the truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are called by the Goſpel.</hi> All that can from thence be gathered is thus much, that ſanctification and belief of the truth, or obedience, is the way to accompliſh that end, unto which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth intend; for there are three things to be conſidered:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The act of Election, and that hath been punctually proved, both to matter, manner and time.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The end of Election, which is the advancement of Gods grace, in bringing veſſels of mercy to glory.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119779:32"/>
                  <item>3. <hi>The way or means to accompliſh the end, which is by or through ſanctification or believing the truth.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But it is no other way diſcovered, but as the way and means, no where as the cauſe or foundation, therefore there is no ground from thence to prove that ſanctification and election muſt be both at one time, no more than the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> going through the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan</hi> to be a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that God did not ordain them for <hi>Canaan</hi> or give them promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> before they came into Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was the way to it. The Scripture declares, that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.13. But I know no Scripture that declares, that man ſhall not nor is not elected till he be holy, though they that are elected muſt and ſhall be holy, and they that are holy ſhall ſee the Lord and live with him in glory, not as the efficient and meritorious cauſe, but as the way and means to ſuch an end, If men
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119779:32"/>will draw Syllogiſms from ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt apprehenſions of ſuch divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as the Apoſtle uſeth in thoſe Scriptures, they may as well prove from thence, and with as ſmall a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, that ſanctification is before men are born, as to prove from them Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, election, which is before the world, to be not till men are ſanctified; but to exerciſe wit to prove either of theſe two things is ſophiſtry and no Reaſon, and not becoming a Saint to meddle with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 3. No men can be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in CHRIST, till they be in CHRIST, but no men are in CHRIST till they believe or truſt in CHRIST, for the elect <hi>Epheſians</hi> were once out of CHRIST <hi>chap.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Men are ſaid to be truly and really in CHRIST two ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by election, and ſo we are all in CHRIST, he being the publick perſon in whom all elections were comprehended, and all the elect are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119779:33"/>in him, before they are brought forth, as every man is in <hi>Adam</hi> before they are born; this laſt affirmation they themſelves do grant, and ſo they muſt the other, if they do but truly view the minde of God in his Word, and not draw Reaſons from bare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, without diſcovering the true intention; now if they could prove that no man in no ſenſe is in CHRIST till he doth believe, then they ſay ſomething, or elſe their Argument is of no force; for we are one with them in their ſecond being in CHRIST, which is when we are called, and in that ſenſe even the elect of God, till they are converted, they are without God and without hope, and by nature the children of wrath as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. But before ever they are brought home to CHRIST in the ſecond ſenſe, they were in CHRIST in the firſt ſenſe, or elſe CHRIST would not have ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other Sheep I have which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119779:33"/>are not of this Fold, them will I bring in,</hi> ſo that they did belong to CHRIST, as his particular Sheep before he brought them in, and that there is ſuch a property and unity before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; you will ſee, if you ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minde theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. Now there is an outward being in CHRIST, which is onely the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of CHRIST, that men may be in and fall according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 15.2, 6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. But I ſhall not ſpeak to that.</p>
            <p>They have ſome other Objections about truſting in CHRIST, and believing in CHRIST, but we have ſaid enough to that already, ſhewing that faith and all other obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not a cauſe of, but flows from that privilege, according to theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.43. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other Objections
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119779:34"/>that do ariſe from ſome other miſtakes of Scripture, which I ſhall take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak ſomething to in my declaring the third thing I promiſed you, to wit, your miſtakes, which are the cauſe of your ſtumbling.</p>
            <p>The ſixth thing, which is, that the publiſhing of the fore-mentioned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, which is the Goſpel, is Gods way or means to effect or produce faith or other Goſpel obedience in the hearts of his own; as to this, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little difference between you and I, and the ſpeaking much to it will not upon that account add much to the deciding the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and others, therefore I ſhall onely ſet down the Scriptures to prove it, and ſo leave it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more to this but come to the ſeventh Particular.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that faith which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in obedience to truth, by the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119779:34"/>diſcoveries of the Goſpel of CHRIST, is not the bringing up of ſomething that is in men before converſion, but it is a peculiar work of God, which Nature in the higheſt improvement is not capable of, till converſion or the new work of grace be wrought, which is Gods, not upon a common but a ſpecial, and Goſpel account, wrought by him.</p>
            <p>Now dear Friend, before I ſpeak to this particular, give me leave to ſpeak two or three words to you, relating to ſome things that do very much trouble me in relation to the abuſe of this truth, for there are two truths mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably abuſed, even by them that do profeſs the Lord; the one is, that all the power we have to act or do things, in a Goſpel ſenſe, is produced alone by the power and Spirit of God, not upon a common but a ſpecial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that the beſt of Saints while they live here have ſin;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119779:35"/>now theſe truths are abuſed thus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort thoſe that profeſs the Lord to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in duty, or reprove them for any neglect in duty, preſently this is replied, We can do no more than we have power, which is a truth in its ſenſe, but it is ſadly applied, for when God hath begun to work grace in us, the way to increaſe in ſtrength is, to improve what we have by carefull watching and waiting hourly and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Lord, and they that do ſo wait and walk, have experience that God will not be wanting to increaſe ſtrength according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſai</hi> 40.31. <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end</hi> 4.<hi>v. Iſai</hi> 64.5. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. And the truth is, were this practized, there would not be ſuch ſad unſaintlike walkings, as now appear to be among them that profeſs the Lord, both in their pride, faſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world, covetouſneſs, frothy language, wanton carriages, and other
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119779:35"/>unſaintlike practices, that it is a hard thing to know a ſaint from a ſinner, in his daily practice and converſation, unleſs you finde them in particular acts of worſhip; which is that which doth ſadly wound the Name of God, and the glory of CHRIST among men. I do not ſpeak this for to accuſe others onely, but withall to bear witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelf for my former unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walkings, wherein my daily watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and waitings, and exact conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving faith, was not kept alive, and therefore I died, but bleſſed be the Lord who hath diſcovered the truth of this to my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now they abuſe the ſecond truth thus; come to ſome Profeſſors and tell them of their pride, faſhions of the world, covetouſneſs, paſſion, or courtly complements, frothy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, manifeſting that theſe things are unbecoming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aints, and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with a growing heart; this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently is replied, Every one hath ſin,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119779:36"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, the very beſt of Saints had ſin, and ſo I confeſs have I; this they anſwer, and peradventure they will ſay, they groan under it, which is a perfect deceit; for though there is ſin in the people of God, yet there is a daily growth and getting ground of it, by improving faith in the bloud of CHRIST, and by exact waiting and watching, by which the ſin of the heart, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the will and the minde is kept under, and there is not an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of any one ſin, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in truth.</p>
            <p>And therefore thoſe that do ſhelter themſelves under truth, in this ſenſe, and do not daily grow and get po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer againſt ſin, let them know this from a heart that knows it from wofull experience, that they onely live in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not in the power and ſpirit of truth, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> witneſs of the truth of the now birth or work of grace which God hath wrought in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119779:36"/>them that are his. Now having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered what troubles me, and what makes me ſo unwilling to mention theſe truths, but with diſcovering alſo wherein men do abuſe them. I ſhall now ſay no more, but come to the proof of this ſeventh Particular, and for the proof of that minde theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119779:37"/>to make good this truth is very full and clear, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can be know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Which fully declares that the receiving or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining through faith, the truths of the Spirit of God, is a work which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or natural men before converſion, are not capable of it nor able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, but it is a ſpecial work of the Spirit of God, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Verily, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 5. he ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Where you ſee the 2. ſpecial employments of faith, to wit,

            <p>Both which are to be done through faith, CHRIST doth here affirm it is a work impoſſible for a natural man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119779:37"/>to do, or any thing in nature to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form before converſion or the new birth, which appears in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.6. which work is ſingularly Gods by his Spirit, according to his own good will and pleaſure, which CHRIST af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. of the ſaid <hi>Chapter.

Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im's</hi> experience doth teſtifie this, that repentance, ſmiting, and being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med followeth turning, and that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing in this Goſpel ſenſe, in the act of converſion, is Gods ſingular work, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>change his skin? or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> The compariſon declares, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for unconverted man that lives in ſin to do good as good, that is to ſay, to do any Goſpel work. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119779:38"/>theſe teſtimonies which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I deſire you further to minde theſe Scriptures, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For it is God that works in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> So it is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Gods work produced by his good pleaſure. Suitable to that is <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p>Now as for the ſecond, which is, what the nature of the work is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeak of the nature of faith, give me leave to ſpeak a word or two of the new birth or converſion, which of neceſſity muſt be wrought before any work or employment of faith can appear; and the truth is my dear Friend, if we cannot witneſs the new birth we are not in a capacity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form one another of the things of God, for till then we are but natural, and not fit for ſuch an employment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>Now this work of converſion and new birth I ſhall preſent it to you thus, it is by the glorious and powerfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119779:38"/>or diſcovery of the glory of God in CHRIST, which doth ſo ſeize upon the ſoul, and convincingly conquers the ſoul, that the ſoul in the diſcoveries of that light is ſo killed and made ſilent, and confounded in the ſenſe of his own unſuitableneſs to God, and undonneſs without CHRIST, that the heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently made to loath and abominate it ſelf, and whatſoever was wrought or done before CHRIST came, and is ſo reſtleſly carried out for CHRIST, that the ſoul cannot reſt till it doth enjoy him, that is, till he can ſee a propriety in him, or enjoy him as his own, which is alone done through believing.</p>
            <p>Now faith is a ſupernatural light and life ſet up in the ſoul, by Gods cauſing the creature to aſſent to, and cloſe with the authority of Gods truth and tenders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I would come to the next thing, but there is one or two Objections by the way, which I judg ſome may make againſt what I hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Query 1. <hi>This that you have ſpoke or declared ſeems to unpower the creature ſolely, as if it had no power before the new birth, which ſeems very contrary to Scripture, which ſpeaks of the creatures improving their Talent.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Truth by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining another. Conſider what the Lord hath ſhewed me in the ſearching
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119779:42"/>of the Scripture, I ſhall lay down briefly in theſe Particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That every man naturally hath a Talent, which he is bound by the Law of God to improve.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That this Talent or Power in the higheſt improvement is but to anſwer the moral Law, or ſo much of it as nature is capable of retaining.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That they who do thus improve it, do very much come up to the anſwering of the righteouſneſs of the Law, as</hi> Paul <hi>did before converſion, Phil.</hi> 3.5, 6.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>When creatures do thus improve their Talent in the anſwer of the moral Law, or ſo much as their nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of;</hi> Though there is an enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that, in a Scripture ſenſe, and the righteouſneſs of CHRIST, yet CHRIST ſeems to have ſome kinde of love to that improvement; and therefore you may ſee in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. when the young man came to him, though he was unacquainted with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, yet in his improvements
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119779:42"/>had very much anſwered the Law, and therefore the Text ſaith, CHRIST <hi>looked upon him and loved him;</hi> ſo that ſuch improvements of nature in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a Law is more pleaſing to CHRIST than the embezling a mans Talent, polluting of nature in the neglect of improvement.</item>
               <item>5. Conſider, <hi>If there be ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſuch an improvement, and ſo much owned, certainly it is good for men to be exact in it.</hi> And it is very much my judgment, that God approves of and meets men there; if ſo, I think we are to wait upon God there. And yet this will not prove that men have power by improvement of nature to work up their hearts in a Goſpel ſenſe for the entertaining of CHRIST; though this improvement be a way to wait upon God in; for even Goſpel Ordinances, or outward means of Grace is commonly that which God is met in, and God meets ſouls there, but yet that doth not prove that the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119779:43"/>Ordinances have power in themſelves to bring up to grace; nay if men ſo reſt on them, or look upon power in them, not looking up to God, above them, then they are ſo far from coming to God, that they and their performance is condemned and loathed by God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſai</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 66.3. The ſame we are to conſider in this, and much more; for I ſee clearly by Scripture, there are more promiſes fixt to Goſpel Ordinances than are to the improvements of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities, though both are good, yet neither is able to bring up to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but in the higheſt abilities of either we are to conſider the work of Grace or new Birth to be produced, by the working of Gods mighty power, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and beyond both; and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearly, if you conſider theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</item>

            </list>
            <p>I mean in relation to a conjunction with CHRIST, as having any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or power performing the new Birth, which is ſoly done of God; and verily there is a greater and more eminent appearance of Gods power in converting ſuch a man, who by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119779:44"/>hath made himſelf righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to the Law, than in converting him that is a greater ſinner, which is clear from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 11.32. The caſe you may ſee in the proud Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.10, 11, 12, 13.

And ſo much in anſwer to theſe Queries, onely dear Friend, that we may underſtand Truth truly, let us draw up the reſult thus, when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of any power in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before the new Birth, it is onely that ſmall proportion of power, which is to be improved in anſwer to the righteouſneſs of a moral Law, ſo far as the diſcovery of it is retained in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and when I declare this Truth which the Scripture owns, to wit, that the creature hath no power, that is, to a work of Grace in a Goſpel ſenſe, which is Gods peculiar work, not in a common but in a ſpecial and Goſpel account, which work the former abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119779:45"/>is far below, and in the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is not able to perform.</p>
            <p>Peradventure you may make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Query, which you were pleaſed to expreſs when I ſaw you, which is,</p>
            <p>Query. <hi>What is done before this new Birth, and that which is done ſince, is all by the power of God; if by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, why make we diſtinction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We do not make any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of power, as it is conſidered in God, for the power of God is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidable in himſelf; but our diſcourſe relates to the exerciſe of Gods power as to us, and that is diſtinguiſhable, and is to be conſidered, either higher or lower, either common or ſpecial, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Job</hi> 23.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 26.14. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 79.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.43. <hi>Epheſ</hi> 1.19. <hi>Col</hi> 1.11.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119779:45"/>not to all, and they that have the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may and do many times want the later; for your better underſtanding of that Truth, do but mind <hi>Deut</hi> 29.v.2. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>called unto all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſaid unto them, Ye have ſeen all that the Lord did before your eys in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and unto all his ſervants, and unto all his Land:</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>The great temptations which thine eys have ſeen, the ſigns and thoſe great miracles.</hi> Now all that <hi>Moſes</hi> diſcovers there, is to manifeſt the exerciſe of Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in a common or general ſenſe, but doth not at all include the peculiar exerciſes of Gods power as to Grace, which we have been all this while a ſpeaking of; therefore he ſaith <hi>v.</hi>4. <hi>Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, nor eys to ſee, and ears to hear, unto this day.</hi> The ſame you may underſtand in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. applied to <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. <hi>ch.</hi> 19.11. <hi>John</hi> 6.65. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119779:46"/>to minde, and not to conclude any thing in oppoſition to this Truth, from the unity of power that is in God, but ſeriouſly minde the exerciſe of his power as to us, and then you will finde, that you have no ground to propound ſuch a Query, or to ſtumble at your apprehenſions of the unity of the power in God; but I ſhall ſay no more as to that Query.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhould come to the eighth Particular, which is, that it is Gods minde and way, and therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt be ſo, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Grace, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of Faith in the hearts of his own, that this Goſpel is to be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſcovered to all without any exemption, as to the declaration it ſelf, to which I ſhall ſay little, it being ſo clear, onely refer you to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which declare,

            <p>Now I know there are ſome that will make ſome Objections further to what hath been ſaid, which I deſire to mention, and give my Anſwer to.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>It is clear from what you have ſaid, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>is to be preſented to all, and that he is enjoyed by none but through believing; and you ſay, the power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is ſoly of God, and not by any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the ability of nature before the new Birth; if ſo, how can it be juſt with God to condemn them that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſeeing the power is not of them but in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I judg this very miſtake to be a chief ground of your ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and therefore for the clearing up of that, according to the third Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119779:47"/>in my writing, wherein I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to clear up the Juſtice of God; in this caſe I ſhall deſire you not to ſtand upon curioſity of words, but in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart owning the Truth of God, to conſider with me theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>is to be preſented to all, that's not diſputable, that Faith is the way or condition of the Goſpel, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and ſalvation by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that is clear.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That this Faith thus conſidered, is not in the power of the creature to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by its ability from Gods authority in a common ſenſe, but it is a peculiar gift in a Goſpel ſenſe, by the grace of God given to ſome and not to all, that is clear from theſe Scriptures, Matth.</hi> 13.11, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Minde, that notwithſtanding all this Gods juſtice is clear, not onely as to the prerogative of his will, which we have no ground to diſpute againſt, but is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119779:47"/>alſo clear to us, if you minde theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, it is in the power of God to condemn all, it is onely grace and love that he ſaves any, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5, 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth condemn no man, if you look upon the meritorious cauſe, not for the creatures not expreſſing of a power of believing in entertaining CHRIST, but for the exerciſing of a power in rejecting CHRIST, ſhould God condemn creatures for their not exerciſing a power in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving CHRIST, then he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for what they have not, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. but he condemns them for their rejecting CHRIST, which power they have: it is true the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>He that believes not is damned,</hi> for not believing, is a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an abid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in a ſtate without CHRIST, which is a ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. It is alſo ſaid, that <hi>they are
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119779:48"/>condemned, becauſe they believe not the Son of God;</hi> but that cauſe is the declarative cauſe; but the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, which is, that God doth and will go upon to clear up his juſtice by, is not the creatures refuſing to exerciſe a power in receiving CHRIST, for that they have not, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. but it is the exerciſing of a power of darkneſs in rejecting CHRIST, and that men have, and God is juſt in doing it, and that, that is the ground God will go upon is clear from theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118.22. And ſo much in anſwer to this Objection.</p>
            <p>Now there are other Objections, which I judg may occaſion miſtakes, but I ſhall ſpeak to them in the next thing, which is the third Particular that I promiſed in the beginning of my writing, to wit to diſcover your miſtakes, which, the cauſe of your ſtumbling, in which diſcovery you will ſee ſome of the Objections that further
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119779:48"/>may be made, both expreſt and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now as for the miſtakes which is the cauſe of your ſtumbling, they are many, I ſhall mention ſo many as I have been acquainted with, which are as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the meaſuring or judging of mans ability by the extent of Gods authority, which is manifeſt in his Word, for in all the Scripture God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his authority over us, and your miſtakes are from his authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the creatures ability, as in ſuch Scriptures where God ſaith, <hi>Do this and you ſhall live,</hi> and <hi>Turn your ſelves,</hi> or be this or be that, which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are principally to diſcover Gods authority, but not the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ability; when man fell he loſt his ability, but this change wrought no alteration in God, if no change in God, then why ſhould any change be in his language? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f God had changed that way of his language, the creature would have been apt to conceive, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119779:49"/>in mans fall there had been a change of Gods power or authority as well as of the creatures ability, which is not ſo.</p>
            <p>A ſecond miſtake is your not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of cauſes, putting no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the eſſential, meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inſtrumental and final cauſes, and ſo it occaſions you to conclude, God or ſome of his eminent acts done in himſelf to be ſubject to ſomething that are but inſtrumental cauſes, and ſo you do bring the efficient cauſe into ſubjection unto the inſtrumental cauſe, and ſometimes the effects of the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe is declared in Scripture as a declarative cauſe, as, <hi>He that believes not is damned;</hi> or as an inſtrumental cauſe, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now your not underſtanding cauſes, is an occaſion of your ſtumbling.</p>
            <p>A third miſtake is, your not apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Scripture with another, in the underſtanding of the extent of ſome expreſſions in Scripture, as the word [all] and the word [world.]</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:119779:49"/>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Now the word [all] and the word [world] they are diverſly taken, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the word [all] doth ſignifie ſome of all ſorts, as appears in theſe Scriptures, Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.12.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>The word [all] doth ſignifie the greater part, as in Luke</hi> 16.26. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>The word [all] is many times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with limitation unto the preſent ſubject, according to theſe Scriptures, Heb.</hi> 12.8.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So the word [world] ſometimes is taken for a part, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>ch.</hi> 15.18, 19. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for the better part, as Profeſſors in the world, <hi>John</hi> 12.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for the wicked of the world, according to theſe Scriptures, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>chap</hi> 6.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.22 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for the whole world,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119779:50"/>comprehending every thing in the world, according to theſe Scriptures, as <hi>Joh</hi> 34.18. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 24.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24.</p>
            <p>Now not diſtinguiſhing the extent of words, applying one Scripture with another, is very dangerous, and a ſpecial cauſe of your ſtumbling.</p>
            <p>A fourth cauſe relating to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of God in Scripture, is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying of things to the ſubject, that is expreſt in a particular Scripture, without underſtanding that Scripture by another, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>As I live, I delight not in the death of a ſinner.</hi> From which Particular you conclude all ſinners.</p>
            <p>Now if you look in the Scriptures you will ſee your ſelves miſtaken, for there are three ſorts of ſinners.</p>
            <p>One ſort that ſins out of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gods mercy, and upon that account reſolves to ſin, <hi>Deu.</hi> 29.19. We will <hi>add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt,</hi> for God will be mercifull; See what the Lord
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119779:50"/>ſaith in <hi>v.</hi>20. <hi>The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this Book ſhall light upon him.</hi> If ſo, then this cannot be the ſinner God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort of ſinners, are thoſe that ſin and are not ſenſible of their ſinning, but rather thinks it goes well with them when they ſin, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the world doth; this ſort of ſinner God ſpeaks of in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, 18. and <hi>Iſai</hi> 27. Now if you look in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.26. God there ſwears he will ſhew them no mercy. And in <hi>Iſai</hi> 27.11. there God doth affirm, he will ſhew no mercy to them. Now both theſe ſorts of ſinners cannot be thoſe God intends, when he ſaith, <hi>As I live, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the death of a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third ſort of ſinners, are ſinners in a Goſpel ſenſe and they are thoſe that CHRIST 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, <hi>I come not to ſave the righteous but ſinners;</hi> as in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119779:51"/>theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.32. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And thoſe ſinners appear to be ſuch, and are declared to be ſuch, when they have through the gracious appearance of God a diſcovery of themſelves to themſelves, that in the ſenſe of their ſins groan and long after JESUS CHRIST. Theſe are thoſe that CHRIST invites, <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you reſt.</hi> And ſo much of that Scripture, and ſo in ſome other Scriptures, you take one perſon for another, miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the drift or ſcope of what is there intended, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, <hi>and hath counted the bloud of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now your miſtake is, in the taking
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119779:51"/>one perſon for another, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not intend in the word [he] by which he was ſanctified, the party that treads the bloud of CHRIST under feet, for it is not he that is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, but it is CHRIST that is ſanctified; now ſanctification is to be ſet apart, and it is CHRIST alone that was ſet apart through the bloud of the covenant, through that God ſanctified him, through that he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf, according to <hi>John</hi> 17. For CHRIST was capable of no other ſanctification, and if any man with an ingenious heart will but reade that Verſe as it is in the Tranſlation, though there is much more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, otherwiſe they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, but the party there ſanctified is properly intended CHRIST, and not he that treads, unleſs they will overthrow the intent of this Scripture, and make Scripture to be of private interpretation, which is not to be done, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.20. I might mention
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119779:52"/>many other places of Scripture, as to the miſtakes of perſons, taking all for ſome, and one for another, I onely mention theſe two or three for the reſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, as thoſe former miſtakes doth ariſe from your miſtakes of the Letter of the Scripture, as it is ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. <hi>You err not knowing the Scripture,</hi> that is comprehended in what we have already ſaid, but ſee what followeth, <hi>You err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> that is to ſay, the power and authority of Scripture, which all are ignorant of till the truth of God in Scripture is made good in them, ſo that a fifth cauſe of your miſtakes, which I much fear, is your unacquaintedneſs with the power of God in Scripture, that is the Scriptures being made good in you, as to the work of converſion or the new birth; for dear Friend, though I am unwilling to ſpeak any thing that hath the face of cenſuring; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119779:52"/>but judg, that if ever the power and authority of God had paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in the great work of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there would need no further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument but preſent experience to convince ſuch a ſoul, that power to ſtand up before the Lord, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the tenders of CHRIST, is ſoly and alone the work of God, not upon a common or a general account, but in a ſpecial and peculiar ſenſe. And ſo much of this fifth Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>A ſixth miſtake is your confining your judgment of the eſſentiality of God the unchangeableneſs of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential will, to the viſibility of God in his outward Word and actions, as they are in our view; and though thoſe things do declare the outward actions of God, as they relate to our actings towards him, yet they are not given to us to judg of, and meaſure the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love of God in himſelf to us by; I mean that good will and love
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119779:53"/>that is in himſelf, and hath no depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon any thing out of himſelf, for God is ſaid to repent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. He is ſaid to forſake, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.33, 39.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 2.15. He is ſaid to be grieved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. He is ſaid to go down and ſee if things were ſo, according to the cry of the ſins of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.20, 21. as if he had not known before, the ſame is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.15. Now theſe expreſſions doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the outward acts of God, as they relate to our acting towards him, or the manifeſting the viſibility of God, as it is in our view, and not to meaſure the eſſentiality of God and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of his love and good will by, for if you do you will both wrong God &amp; deceive your own ſoul. And ſo much of this ſixth miſtake.</p>
            <p>There are many more cauſes of your ſtumbling, I onely thought good to give you theſe which at preſent I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, deſiring the Lord by them to manifeſt the reſt, and to clear up truth in your ſoul, that you may no longer
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119779:53"/>ſtumble, but through the manifeſtation of Gods grace, you may be made able to underſtand truth as itis in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Now before I come to ſhew you the ſad Abſurdities that muſt of neceſſity follow your opinion, and how injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous you are by that unto the glory of Gods grace, to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to your own ſoul, I ſhall from what hath been ſaid already give you a brief Anſwer to your Queries and Abſurdities, which briefly take thus.</p>
            <p n="1">Query 1. <hi>If</hi> Chriſt <hi>died not for all, What ground hath any man to believe he died for him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have diſcovered the fallacy of that Query, by ſhewing ye that the efficient cauſe of our believing in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is more ſupernatural, heavenly and ſpiritual, than ſuch low exerciſe of a common Reaſon, as to conclude CHRIST died for us, becauſe he died for all. The work of Faith I have ſhewed ye to be of nother nature.</p>
            <p n="2">Query 2. <hi>How can God be ſaid to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119779:54"/>to be juſt to condemn thoſe perſons for whom</hi> Chriſt <hi>never died?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> How can God be juſt to condemn them for whom CHRIST died? I mean in your ſenſe: but I have anſwered this Query fully, in ſhewing you that CHRIST taſted death for every man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhewed you that it was juſt with God to condemn all, and it is onely ſingular mercy that he ſaved any.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have ſufficiently declared from Scripture, that the meritorious cauſe of condemnation, is not for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures not exerciſing of a power of Faith in receiving CHRIST, but for exerciſing darkneſs in rejecting CHRIST; and though creatures want the firſt, yet they are poſſeſt of the laſt.</p>
            <p n="3">Query 3. <hi>How can remiſsion of ſins be preached to theſe for whom</hi> Chriſt <hi>never died?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have andſwered that, by ſhewing it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119779:54"/>is the great deſign of God to have CHRIST preſented to all, that from amongſt all his own through his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might be called to believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have ſhewed to you, that there is no excluſion as to the tenders of the Goſpel; for diſtinctions in that caſe are no where but in Ordination and Application; and I have clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to you, that one depends upon the prerogative of his will, and the other is produced by the ſingularity of his love and grace, which in juſtice he might have with-held from all; but for the advancement of his glory and grace he is pleaſed to beſtow on ſome.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>Query</hi> 4. I have fully anſwered in my Anſwer to the ſecond Query, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout clearing up of Gods juſtice, and in ſhewing you what is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of mans damnation.</p>

            <p>The Abſurdities are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You deny the Prerogative of Gods will,</hi> as if he had not power to do with his own, as ſeems good to him, croſſing theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Iſai</hi> 45.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 43.13.</p>

            <p n="3">3. You do exceedingly undervalue God and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Now your holding Election of qualities and not of perſons, cannot heal the lameneſs of your opinion, nor any way maintain this great deſign of God; for if Salvation and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be carried on upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, relating to the creatures doing or not doing, then Gods glory in his grace, is not exalted but denied, for if of works, then of debt, according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. And if by debt, then we have wherewithall to boaſt; and if God who might juſtly have condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, doth not by his free gift and pleaſure ſave ſome, then the ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his love in the veſſels of grace is denied; and then for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his power and juſtice in the veſſels of wrath, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 is ſoly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119779:63"/>and the prerogative of his will and pleaſure abſolutely denied; the ſadneſs of this Abſurdity will look grim upon your face in the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Your opinion is ſo inconſiſtent to truth that it deſtroys it ſelf, for if CHRIST died for all alike, then he muſt needs ſatisfie for all the ſins of all. Now that he hath ſatisfied for all the ſins of the Elect, I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and if for all in that ſenſe, then all muſt be ſaved, or elſe infidelity is not a ſin; for if it be a ſin and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſatisfied for all ſin, and died for all alike, as you affirm, then infidelity cannot deſtroy, or elſe you muſt hold, he died not for that ſin, then not for all ſin.
